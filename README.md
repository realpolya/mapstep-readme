MapStep was created by software engineer and architectural designer [Polina Stepanova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/realpolya/) as an efficiency and organization tool for architects, real estate developers, contractors, civil engineers, and urban planners.

The goal is to support creating better architecture with clarity, speed, and creativity. We want to maximize productivity and increase ROI from each development project.

The application intends to serve as a centralized database for obtaining zoning, planning, and building code information for each individual plot of land across the United States. The building code information has been unneccesarily bureaucratic and disjointed – mapStep was created out of an aspiration to fix the system and streamline the design and construction-related processes.

Based on Los Angeles as a sample city and utilizing public [Los Angeles County Assessor's portal](https://portal.assessor.lacounty.gov/) as the primary API endpoint, mapStep enhances the permit acquisition process and broadens the imagination horizon by suggesting construction possibilities. The land research is significantly augmented with AI technologies.
